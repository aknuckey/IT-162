 	<p class="about">I’ve been a Barber for the last 13 years. I love working with people and helping to bring out the best in them. That career is coming to an end for me and I hope to build a new one within the Web Development field as a Project Manager.</p>
    <p class="about">Born and Raised in Seattle, when I’m not working or studying, I enjoy spending time in the beautiful mountains that surround us and working with my hands. Fixing up our house, working on cars, playing with the dogs, hiking, hunting, snowboarding, exercising, and spending time with friends and family.</p> 
    <p class="about">I look forward to what the future holds and I hope to have fun on the way there!</p>
