                            Math 'n' Stuff was established in 1993 against all odds and all advice that a "Math" store could never be successful...
                            Gini Wingard-Phllips started the business to change people's minds about Mathematics; this is why she calls herself a "Math Evangelist."
                            Mikaela Wingard-Phillips, a second generation entrepreneur, is not only carrying forward her mother's legacy in Mathematics and Education, but also reframing the vision for Math 'n' Stuff's current evolution.
